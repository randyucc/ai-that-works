# Suggest Titles Command

This command runs a CLI that suggests episode titles from a transcript after completing a live session.

## Overview
Find the relevant directory and run the title suggester CLI.

## Steps
1. **Check current date** - Use bash to verify today's date, run `bash(ls .)` to see the top level of folder structure here

1. **Get the Folder for the Just Completed Episode**
   - Each episode has a folder in the repo with the date followed by the title (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-case-episode-title`)
   - Ask the user to choose from the most recent 5 episode folders *that are not in the future*.
   - Give the user an option to provide their own if they do not want to select one of the options presented, but ensure it exists in the repo.

2. **Verify the Directory**
Make sure there is a `transcript.txt` and a `meta.md` in the directory. If there isn't, ask the user for them.

3. **Gather the Required Information from the meta.md**
Gather the following information from the `meta.md`.
    - episode title (current working title)

4. **Run the title suggester CLI**
Run the following script:
```bash
cd 2026-02-17-automating-aitw
uv run python -m src.title_suggester.suggest_titles --transcript <absolute path to transcript> --title <episode title> --output <absolute path to episode's directory>
```

## Important Notes
- Use TodoWrite to track progress through these steps
- Use absolute paths for `--transcript` and `--output` arguments
- The command must be run from inside the `2026-02-17-automating-aitw/` directory
- Output is saved to `titles.json` in the episode's directory
- Think deeply about the structure and format before making changes
- Verify all information is present before proceeding
